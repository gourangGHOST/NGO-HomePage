            </h1>
            <p>It's 1st of August; we all had a meeting about what should be our first step after formally registering
              "Aadi Foundation" as an NGO. We were scrambling with innovative ideas, but later on, we agreed upon
              keeping it plain and simple. The first step on the list was to arrange funds, all our members contributed
              and got some online donations; very thankful to you guys for all your efforts we were able to do some
              community service, and then we contacted some volunteers for the food distribution. Once all these things
              were done I went to my mother and asked if she can cook something good and healthy for our first programme
              of food distribution<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> believe me, or not she was more than happy
                to contribute in her way, she took off from the office even called some of her cohorts to help her
                prepare a delightful, sumptuous meal filled with love, care and some sense of proud about our
                initiative. Then all the members made lunchboxes and packed and loaded them neatly. We are all set to
                go. Soon after it started to rain heavily and all our motivation took a blow but we did not relent we
                waited to slow it down and guess what it does reduce to mere drizzling. Once we saw the rain is slowing
                down, we took off without any second thoughts with our moms worrying about us catching a cold. We were
                pumped with energy as all in their primes are; we drove off to Pitampura, to be precise behind V.I.P.S
                college, where we once visited before might a year ago as interns under some NGO, this feeling was
                different. Of course, it has to be different now we are running our small organisation to widen the
                scope of community service which is again in some sense another contribution to society.
                After landing on the street we had some conversations with the kids on the street and a realisation
                about the disparity that exists in our society and how severe it is, on the one hand, there was a
                college for higher studies, where kids like us get their education and on another one, we have these
                poor children who are enrolled within municipal schools and we felt worst when we get to know that some
                were dropouts at the mere age of 13 years because they cannot afford to school, that made me wonder when
                education in govt. schools are free then how come someone cannot afford a thing which has no monetary
                liability attached to it and I asked that girl, Why? To this, she answered, 'Bhaiya Mummy-Papa ke sath
                kam krne jana padta hai, agar na jao toh khaana kam banta hai' this left our team shocked and a little
                bit sad, but that's the truth we faced there and felt we were not doing enough to fill the gap of
                disparity between those kids dropping out of schools in the age of learning, the age where we all
                privileged one's spent their time building their bases without any worries of thinking about, 'How to
                arrange a second meal of the day(to this we feel gratitude towards our parents). As a matter of fact,
                after this the team was sad and morale was also low but was resolved to take this situation head on and
                decide soon enough we will help her find some way that at least made her capable of completing her basic
                education. Then, our team and volunteers distributed the 'Kadhi-chawal' boxes to the crowd present
                there. After this, we all dove off to a second location in a nearby basti, where we met some of the best
                smiles and questions like, 'Bhaiya app khana baat rahe ho na? Muje 2 boxes dena ghar bi leke jana hai'
                our team made an exception for the demand of that boy and gave him two boxes. After distributing around
                300 Boxes, there were still people lined up to this left with our hands folded that we will return soon
                enough with more. After all this, we came back to our office space (of course home) partially wet and
                tired but with a feeling of comfort, look on our parent's faces and inner happiness; things which cannot
                be bought or traded. </span>
